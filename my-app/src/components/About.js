           Hey there! I'm Nima Norouzi, a computer science student based in Vancouver, British Columbia. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.
           </p>

           <p className="mb-10 px-0 sm:px-0 smleading-relaxed">My academic journey has been both challenging and rewarding. 
            From understanding the core structures of computation to mastering programming 
            languages like Python, Java, and Racket, I've embraced every opportunity to
             expand my knowledge and skills.</p>

            <p className="mb-10 px-0 sm:px-0 smleading-relaxed"> Outside of academics, I find joy in creative projects.
                  I've worked on a Java-based soccer manager simulation game,
                  where players can compete against various teams and strategize
                 their way to victory. Additionally, I'm part of a team developing 
                 "Math2Latex," an innovative application that converts handwritten 
                 mathematical expressions into LaTeX scripts.</p>

            <p className="mb-10 px-0 sm:px-0 smleading-relaxed">When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me
               playing chess or creating beats and exploring the 
               world of music production.</p>


            <p className="mb-10 px-0 sm:px-0 smleading-relaxed"> In a nutshell, I'm a computer science enthusiast with a flair for 
              creativity and a love for connecting with others. 
              If you share any of these interests or simply want to chat about tech,
               music, or life in general, feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always up for a 
               good conversation! </p>
